# Agent Architecture Improvements

## Overview

The chatbot structure has been significantly improved with a new agent-based architecture that provides better separation, naming, and tool capabilities.

## Problems with Previous Structure

### 1. Monolithic Configuration

- **Before**: All assistants crammed into one `ai-assistants-config.ts` file
- **Issues**: Hard to maintain, difficult to extend, poor organization

### 2. Poor Naming Convention

- **Before**: Generic names like `icp-form-tool`, `icp-analysis-tool`
- **Issues**: Not descriptive, confusing, doesn't indicate capabilities

### 3. No Tool Capabilities

- **Before**: Basic chat responses only
- **Issues**: No actionable capabilities, limited functionality

### 4. No Agent-like Features

- **Before**: Simple chat interfaces
- **Issues**: No specialized tools, no context awareness, no workflow guidance

## New Agent Architecture

### 1. Separated Agent Structure

├── index.ts                    # Export all agents
├── types.ts                    # Core agent types
├── agent-manager.ts            # Agent management and tool execution
├── agent-chat.tsx              # Enhanced chat interface
├── agent-button.tsx            # Agent button component
├── company-profile-agent.ts    # Company profile specialist
├── icp-analyzer-agent.ts       # ICP analysis expert
├── campaign-creator-agent.ts   # Campaign creation specialist
├── research-agent.ts           # Market research expert
└── general-guide-agent.ts      # General guidance and navigation
```

### 2. Better Naming Convention

| Old Name                 | New Name                 | Description                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `icp-form-tool`          | `company-profile-agent`  | Intelligent company profile assistant    |
| `icp-analysis-tool`      | `icp-analyzer-agent`     | ICP analysis expert with insights        |
| `campaign-creation-tool` | `campaign-creator-agent` | Creative campaign development            |
| `campaign-research-tool` | `research-agent`         | Market research and competitive analysis |
| `general-guide`          | `general-guide-agent`    | Application guidance and navigation      |
